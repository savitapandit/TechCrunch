The exceptions to this license is as follows:
* Bootstrap by Twitter and the Glyphicon set are licensed under the GPL-compatible [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 Apache License v2.0]

* WP StrapBlogger Lite is about blogging with style. A clean and light WordPress theme built on Twitter Bootstrap with a two 
* column layout format. Sporting the Bootstrap Carousel on the home page to compliment your content (posts) plus a home page 
* intro widget area. The theme supports individual widget areas for blog (post lists), posts (single post) and pages plus 
* four widgets in the footer area â€“ the theme customizer presents the end user with options to hide the navbar on the home 
* page, set slider to fade or slide plus the option to turn on/off the carousel, hide the footer credit links plus add your 
* own custom copyright details. As a design default, posts are rendered with either the featured image, first image in post 
* or a placeholder image if no images are attached to the post. See website for more details and documentation.  

* WP StrapBlogger is translation ready!

* Please note: By default, in Bootstrap the parent menu for dropdown setting is not
* clickable!

* Support for RTL (Right To Left) layout is included althought this is
* yet to be fully tested. So for all those that compose content in an
* RTL language I welcome your feedback and support in making this feature
* right for you all - please report any bugs and I'll do my best to fix
* them ASAP. Code contribution is welcome.
